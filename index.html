<p> I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>
<br>
<p>HTML is cool</p>
<br>
<p>CSS is cooler</p>
<br>
<p>JS is the best</p>
<br>
<p>What do you need to create a website?</p>
<br><li>
Not much!
</li>
<br><li>
A computer (always a good start)
</li>
<br><li>
A text editor (I am using atom)
</li>
<br><li>
A web browser (I am using chrome)
</li>
<br><li>
Some HTML, CSS and JS files
</li>
<br>
<p>Follow my progress on github</p>
